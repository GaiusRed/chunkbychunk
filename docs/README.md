## One-sentence pitch

Chunk By Chunk turns the Overworld into a **single-chunk skyworld** and gives you blocks/items to **expand the world one chunk at a time** by copying chunks from a hidden generation dimension.

## Notes about accuracy

This documentation is based on what’s visible in this repository (resources, recipes, advancements, and code). If you’re using a modpack that overrides configs/recipes, behavior may differ.
